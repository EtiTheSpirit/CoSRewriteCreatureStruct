If you use Visual Studio (as you should), then adding new .lua files requires some extra attention

#1: Go to View -> Properties Window so that it is visible.
#2: Click on your .lua file, look at its properties
#3: Make sure Build Action is set to "Content".
#4: Make sure Copy to Output Directory is set to "Always Copy".

Not doing this will cause the files to not be included in the generated code.
