If you use Visual Studio (as you should), then adding new .lua files requires some extra attention

#1: Go to View -> Properties Window so that it is visible.
#2: Click on your .lua file, look at its properties
#3: Make sure Build Action is set to "Content".
#4: Make sure Copy to Output Directory is set to "Copy Always".

Not doing this will cause the files to not be included in the generated code.

Files that have these properties set will automatically be included in the code.
